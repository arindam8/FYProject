This repository will contain the code for the project 'Analysis of malwares for detection'.

The aim of this project is to work on machine learning models for the problem of malware detection. The architecture that this project follows is that of a heterogeneous ensemble classifiers. It aims to use classifiers on a per-feature basis, which then are tied together, to produce the final prediction.
